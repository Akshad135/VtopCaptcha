# VTOP CAPTCHA SOLVER

A basic project to understand how [selenium](https://selenium.dev/) works.

To use it yourself:

- Clone the repo
- Check the webdriver version and your browser version (Should use a chromium based browser)
- Create a .env file and make the changes as :
  - API_KEY = Your_KEY
  - USERNAME = "USERNAME"
  - password = "password"
    (Note that username field might not work so directly add the username in python file)
- Install requirements.txt

This project uses [CaptchaAI](https://captchaai.com/) to solve the reCaptcha.
